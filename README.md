# DotA-Matches-Predictor

## Goal

The goal of this project is to get hands-on experience writing code in R (and probably Python)
and apply concepts in data science to a real-world problem

## Description

### Question trying to answer

Who will win the match between Team A and Team B?

### Steps to take

1. Obtain data from web (e.g. liquipedia, straff etc.)
2. Analyze data
3. Decide which variables to use (e.g. Total number of matches played between the two teams)
4. Use Markov model or Naive Bayes model or something like that
5. Train and test
